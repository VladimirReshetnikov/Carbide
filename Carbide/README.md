# Carbide

A C# compile-and-run framework that ships as a single npm package, embeds the .NET runtime and Roslyn, and works identically in a browser tab and a Node.js process. Targeted at environments that cannot install the .NET SDK.

**Status:** M0 — Fork skeleton. The C# core builds, publishes a `_framework/` directory, and the npm package skeleton packs. Functional compile/run comes in M1.

## Layout

- [`docs/`](docs/README.md) — vision, architecture, and implementation plan.
- `packages/core/` — the `@carbide/core` npm package root.
  - `src/` — `Carbide.Core.csproj` (the Blazor WASM C# project), plus TypeScript sources under `src/ts/`.
  - `test/` — host-side smoke tests.
- `Directory.Build.props` / `Directory.Build.targets` — shared MSBuild settings for the C# project.

## Build

Prerequisites: .NET 10 SDK with the `wasm-tools` workload (`dotnet workload install wasm-tools`), Node.js ≥ 20.

```bash
cd src/Carbide/packages/core
dotnet publish -c Release src/Carbide.Core.csproj
npm install
npm run build:ts
npm test
```

## Origin

Carbide starts as a structural fork of [WasmSharp](https://github.com/JakeYallop/WasmSharp). See [`ATTRIBUTION.md`](packages/core/ATTRIBUTION.md) for the list of files adapted from upstream sources.
